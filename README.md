Why?
* Cause sitting whole day looking into a lamp is not healthy
* Cause a mobile's screen is often too small and you 'lose' one hand holding it
* Cause information bandwidth is high for human communication including gestures, body language, tone, etc.
* Cause sketching with pen on papers you can reshuffle is awesome for getting a train of thoughts accross quickly
* Cause we should have many different shapes for many different situations

What next?
* instead of rope, use a proper padded frame
* instead of the broom somewhat blocking one hand, the projector+cam will be hung on curve going overhead attached to frame on back
* construction can also be put on edge of table, and beamer and webcam can be rotated towards wall.
* more sensors can be added
* Add a no-hands-portable chair like https://www.lexbyastride.com/
* https://lampix.com/ might be part of this, or at least provide inspiration
The beamer can also be used to show what is in the field of the camera ...
That should actually be a component as such. To be put on this frame, but also hanging from the ceiling, or put on a headband.
Is the beamer fast enough for interlacing it with the camera?

Maybe a RECORD-mode can be triggered with a button on your wrist, or a spoken command.
