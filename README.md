The beamer can also be used to show what is in the field of the camera ...
That should actually be a component as such. To be put on this frame, but also hanging from the ceiling, or put on a headband.
Is the beamer fast enough for interlacing it with the camera?

Maybe a RECORD-mode can be triggered with a button on your wrist, or a spoken command.
